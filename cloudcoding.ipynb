It can also read and modify files.\n","* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n","* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n","\n","### **Why Python?**\n","* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n","* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n","* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines comapared to other programming languages.\n","* Python code can be executed as soon as it is written, meaning that prototyping can be very quick.\n","\n","### **Fun Facts**\n","* Cloud Coding is the brainchild and initiative of Charles Chong. The initiative is supported by JC Kwon.\n","* The intention is to enable non-developers to experience fun with coding, and allow students to continue to code on their own after the lessons via an online coding platform.\n","* Google Colab enables interactive coding using Jupyter Notebook, which allows coding to be performed on both online and offline platforms. \n","\n","### **Python Syntax compared to other programming languages**\n","* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n","* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AedIlms4HgsG"},"source":["## **Let's Start! What to expect?** \n","In this short lesson, you will learn to install F5 SDK Python Module. F5 SDk Module allows specific actions or functions to be called by Python. The module witll interact with F5 through API calls and coders need not make API calls in their codes. This allows developers to quickly compile info or make changes to F5 services.\n","\n","Python modules are installed using PIP, which is a package/module manager for Python. Modules/packages are normally installed for specific environment and not global environment, which helps to reduce unneccesary coding footprint."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DGdT08QeHso0"},"source":["## **Step 1.
